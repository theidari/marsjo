<ol><b>Mars</b> is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System. Mars has long been the subject of human interest. This planet has been explored remotely by spacecraft. In the late 20th century, Earth-based probes have made it possible to learn more about the Martian system, particularly its geology and potential for habitability.</ol>
