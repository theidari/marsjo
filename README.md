<ol><b>Mars</b> is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System. Mars has long been the subject of human interest. This planet has been explored remotely by spacecraft. In the late 20th century, Earth-based probes have made it possible to learn more about the Martian system, particularly its geology and potential for habitability.</ol>

<ol><b>Objective</b></ol>
<ol>
This project, consists of two technical products:</br>

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theidari/marsjo/main/design/dot_main_edt.png" width="7px"> <b>First:</b> scrape titles and preview text from <a href="https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html">Mars News Site</a>
.</br>
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theidari/marsjo/main/design/dot_main_edt.png" width="7px"> <b>Second:</b> scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a <a href="https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html">Mars Temperature Data Site</a>, and answering the following question:</br>
 1. how many months are there on mars?
 2. mow many martian days' worth of data are there?
 3. What is the average low temperature by martian month?
 4. What is the average pressure by martian month?
 5. How many terrestrial (earth) days are there in a martian year?

<p align="center"><ins><b>Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News</b></ins></p>
The result looks as follows , and it is stored as <a href="https://github.com/theidari/marsjo/blob/main/output/News_Result_Data.json">.json</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theidari/marsjo/blob/main/output/News_Result_Data.csv">.csv</a> files.</br>

```python
{'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm",
  'preview': 'For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27.'}  
```

<p align="center"><ins><b>Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data</b></ins></p>

 1. how many months are there on mars? <b>12</b>
 2. mow many martian days' worth of data are there? <b>1867</b>
 3. What is the average low temperature by martian month? </br>
  result for average low temperature is stored in <a href="https://github.com/theidari/marsjo/blob/main/output/min_temp.csv">.csv</a> file and shows in figure [1].</br>
